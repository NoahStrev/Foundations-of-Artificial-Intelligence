//  if the output were output[1] that would mean that team 2 won

 {input: [2,3] , output: [0] },  // team 2 wins
 {input: [2,4] , output: [1] },   // team 4 wins
// now add more data:
 {input: [1,2] , output: [0] },  // team 1 wins
 {input: [1,3] , output: [0] },  // team 1 wins
 {input: [3,4] , output: [0] }   // team 3 wins

// a prob close to 1 will mean that team 4 will win otherwise team 1 will win
